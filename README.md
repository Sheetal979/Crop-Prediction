## Crop Prediction
Agriculture plays a crucial role in our society, and farmers face the challenge of selecting the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various factors such as weather conditions, 
soil characteristics, and market demand. To assist farmers in making informed decisions, we have developed a crop prediction model that leverages machine learning algorithms and data 
analysis.

## Features
1. Predicts the most suitable crop based on historical data and environmental parameters.
2. Provides information on required fertilizers, seeds, and market prices for the recommended crop.
3. Estimates the potential yield in quintal per acre for the recommended crop.
4. User-friendly web application for easy input of local parameters and accessing recommendations.
5. Integration of the model with real-time weather data for accurate predictions.

6. ## Technology Used
1. Python
2. Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
3. Flask (for web application)
4. HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend development)
